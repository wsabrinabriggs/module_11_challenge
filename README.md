# module_11_challenge

Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my code.

I had a difficult time extracting the data from the table in html format. With the help of a tutor from AskBCS, I was able to get unstuck. The problem was when I extracted the elements from the data (what would become the records in my future dataframe) they were showing up as 
lists of BeautifulSoup elements. At first, it just changed the look of my dataframe to where every record had a square bracket around it. I thought maybe that could still work. However, when I tried to change data types, an error appeared stating that basically a BeautifulSoup element 
couldn't be changed to datetime. The tutor helped me build a nested loop with a conditional statement inside it in order to extract the text values of the table's data. 

The saved csv file is located in the Output folder.

The plots are incomplete at this time.
